# Jurisdictions

## Required Conventions
Some conventions are used by the code, and so must be respected. 
    * ReportingUnit names use semicolons to indicate nesting relationships, e.g., `North Carolina;Alamance County;Precinct 064`.

## Optional Conventions
The jurisdiction files in this repository follow certain conventions. Many of these are optional; using different conventions in another copy of the system will not break anything. Internal database names names are standardized as much as possible, regardless of state, following these models:

    * Office
        * `US Senate CO`
        * `US House FL District 5`
        * `PA State Senate District 1`
        * `NC State House District 22`
        * `PA Berks County Commissioner`
        * `DC City Council District 2`
        * `OR Portland City Commissioner Seat 3`
       
    * Party
        * `Constitution Party` (regardless of state or other jurisdiction)
        
    * Candidate Contest
        * `Constitution Party Primary for US Senate CO`
