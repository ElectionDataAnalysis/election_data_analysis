# Jurisdictions

## Required Conventions
Some conventions are used by the code, and so must be respected. 
 * ReportingUnit names use semicolons to indicate nesting relationships, e.g., `North Carolina;Alamance County;Precinct 064`.

## Optional Conventions
The jurisdiction files in this repository follow certain conventions. Many of these are optional; using different conventions in another copy of the system will not break anything.
 * Office names are standardized as much as possible, regardless of state, following these models:
   * `US Senate CO`
   * `US House FL District 5`
   * `PA State Senate District 1`
   * `NC State House District 22`
