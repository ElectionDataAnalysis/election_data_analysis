Remark
Per https://www.ncsbe.gov/Voting-Options/One-Stop-Early-Voting, "one-stop" voting in North Carolina refers to a type of vote center for early in-person absentee voting. "One-stop absentee voting (commonly known as "early voting") allows any registered voter to cast an absentee ballot in person on select days prior to Election Day. Unlike on Election Day, when registered voters can only vote at their specific precinct, one-stop voting allows registered voters to vote at any one-stop absentee voting site in the county. One-stop sites will have all the ballot styles for a given election at each site."
